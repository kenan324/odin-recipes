        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Ajarski khachapuri</strong> It is national dish in country of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)" 
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia</a>.
        The dish is a boat-shaped bread, with a blend of molten feta-like cheese
        and mozzarella and an egg baked into the center—creating a rich, gooey texture.
        It has a crispy outer crust that is slightly yellow that contrasts
        beautifully with the gooey cheese inside.
        </p>    
        <p>When you eat it, you break the yolk, mixing it into the creamy cheese to
        create an even richer flavor. Ajarski Khachapuri is best enjoyed fresh and hot, 
        often served as a comforting breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li class="steps"><strong>Make dough:</strong> Combine milk, water, yeast,
                and sugar in a large bowl.Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, 
                about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, olive oil, and salt; mix until a 
                sticky dough forms.
            </li>
            
            <li class="steps">Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 
                3 minutes, adding in remaining 1/4 cup flour as needed, until dough 
                is very soft but still workable. Form into a ball and place in a 
                lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled 
                in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
                
            </li>
            
            <li class="steps">
                Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).
            </li>
            
            <li class="steps">While dough rises, prepare cheese blend: Toss together feta, 
                Monterey Jack, and mozzarella cheese in a medium bowl. Refrigerate 
                cheese mixture until needed.
            </li>
            
            <li class="steps">Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured 
                surface. Flatten slightly and cut in half. Place 1 dough half on a 
                sheet of parchment paper dusted with flour. Roll out into a rectangle
                about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.
            </li>
            
            <li class="steps">Arrange 1/4 of the cheese mixture in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches 
                from the longest sides. Roll sides up tightly over cheese, forming 
                a canoe shape. Pinch and twist ends to seal. Trim excess parchment 
                and lift dough onto a baking sheet. Shape and stuff remaining dough 
                half. Fill canoes with remaining cheese mixture.
            </li>
            
            <li class="steps">Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Form a 
                well in the center of each khachapuri using a spoon;
                crack an egg inside each well.
            </li>
            
            <li class="steps">Return to the oven and bake until eggs are mostly 
                set, 3 to 4 minutes. Place 2 pats butter over each 
                egg, then sprinkle with salt and cayenne.
            </li>
            
            <li class="steps">Plate khachapuri; tear off one end and use it to 
                stir butter into egg.
            </li>
        </ol>
